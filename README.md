# Business-Insights-360

## Project Overview:

AtliQ Hardware, experiencing rapid growth in recent years, sought to implement data analytics for the first time to gain a competitive edge and support data-driven decision-making across all departments, including finance, sales, marketing, and supply chain. This project aimed to leverage Power BI to provide stakeholders with comprehensive insights, enabling them to make informed decisions in various business areas.

## Learned Power BI Techniques:

- Identifying key questions to ask at the project outset
- Creating calculated columns and measures using DAX
- Developing effective data models and avoiding zero division errors with the divide function
- Using bookmarks for seamless visual transitions and buttons for page navigation
- Building dynamic titles based on filters and applying conditional formatting to highlight key data
- Managing workspaces, collaboration, and access permissions in Power BI Service, and creating Power BI Apps

## Company Background:

AtliQ Hardware, a global company specializing in computer products and accessories, distributes through three main channels: Retailers, Direct Sales, and Distributors. After facing unexpected losses from opening stores in the U.S. based on intuition and basic excel analysis, AtliQ realized the need for a dedicated analytics team to generate data-driven insights and strengthen their position against competitors, who were already using advanced analytics for decision-making.

## Import Data:

The data for this project was stored in a MySQL database. The first step involved importing relevant datasets into Power BI by connecting to the MySQL database using secure credentials.

## Dashboard Design:

The dashboard's Home View provided navigation buttons, allowing users to access specific sections like Finance, Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain, Executive Insights, and Product information. Each section was designed to answer key business questions and support data-driven decisions.
